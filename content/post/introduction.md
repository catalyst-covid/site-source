# The Introduction’s Introduction

Welcome to Catalyst COVID, a series of stories showcasing how societies around the world are turning to mass surveillance for national security, interpersonal trust, and optimizing their economies in the time of a global pandemic. This project developed from a course taught on Cultures of Surveillance at the University of Arizona.

# Background & Stereotypes

The first working implementation of a mass surveillance system as we stereotypically think about today was revealed to the world in 2013 when Edward Snowden released classified documents detailing the United States National Security Agency’s program to gather and record data on nearly all US citizens. However, while the NSA’s system might be thought of as a first of its kind, it was by no means the first mass surveillance system, not even in the United States.

Think back to the last time you applied for a job or rented a house. During either of those steps, you were required to submit to a background and credit check. While these forms of surveillance are hidden in plain view, we rely on them everyday to provide trust in a society where we can’t possibly know everyone we depend on and interact with on a personal level. Thus we developed systems of surveillance in the forms of credentials to manage and verify power in our society.

# A Changing Perspective

Surveillance isn’t just the role of the FBI or CIA, we perform surveillance on a daily basis with everyone we come into contact with by enforcing social norms.
