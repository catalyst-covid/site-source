# Introduction:
Both China and Singapore exhibited dynamic, technical responses to respond to the looming threat of COVID-19, often using surveillance technologies as instruments to 1) trace the spread of the disease through the populace, 2) separate the population into healthy and sick, and 3) prevent further spread of the disease in the existing healthy population.
China is an interesting case study in contagion management, given that the Chinese government created an alert system by which they could respond to potential pandemics after the SARS outbreaks of 2002. Somewhat notably, a lack of reporting by health officials caused this apparatus to fail, even as hospitals filled with cases of a mysterious pneumonia in late 2019. With this said, the eventual realization of the cause of the pandemic and the corresponding gain in understanding of just how much of a problem novel coronavirus was resulted in a swift change in actions from the Chinese government. In Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, the entire city was locked down. It was illegal for citizens to leave their homes or the city in general, and the government moved vast resources to respond to the pandemic in the city. A number of surveillance techniques were used to assist in this effort. Most widely reported were instances when the government tracked cellphones of Wuhan residents who left the city after the lockdown in order to more effectively quarantine them. Also used were various contact tracing apps developed both by the government and by third party organizations that would continually trace the movements of users and suggest to them both areas to avoid and also how likely it was that they themselves were infected. This information was naturally also available centrally, but represents an interesting situation in which a panoptic device was implemented in order to coerce the population into compliance. Instead of the threat of physical violence to impose lockdown conditions, the Chinese government merely utilized a mass surveillance technique that would inform users that it would be known if they were to break quarantine. This necessarily shifts the source of power internally, with users now abundantly aware that since they are always being observed by these applications that they ought to behave ideally in order to minimize their personal chance of infection while also maintaining proper lockdown and quarantine protocols as ordered by the Communist Party.
An interesting result of these surveillance protocols was the use of these surveillance techniques in order to explicitly sort the populace. Several popular Chinese apps (messaging and instant payment applications) were modified to include a short survey for all users to complete. Combined with location data, these pieces of info are used to create a color code that indicates the users personal probability of infection (green for totally okay, yellow for at risk, red for go to a hospital immediately). These codes were used to dictate the social mobility allowed for any particular user (things such as where they can go, if they can leave the house, the like).
 
(Generally from here I want to expand on the various other surveillance techniques other countries have implemented as well, such as temperature measuring, public covid testing measures, maybe other sorts of contact tracing, the like, and give a general overview of these techniques. I then want to do a theoretical analysis of this with either Foucault or Deleuze and that will end the general overview. I then wanna do a by continent thing. Below I’ve included what my entry for Asia may look like (obviously I’m gonna need more than just China to do all of Asia, this is just a sample of what it might look like).
Asia:
# China:
China is noted for its authoritarian response to COVID-19. Surveillance techniques used include digital contact tracing, digital quarantine enforcement, and a fairly unprecedented implemented social hierarchy based on a calculate probability of infection for every citizen. This was implemented in the form of color codes that every Chinese citizen with a phone was likely to have, and were necessary for all different activities (for instance, you had to be green to freely leave your house, which would be checked before you left)
# Singapore
Initially praised for its coronavirus response, Singapore was noted for using digital surveillance and location data for the purpose of contact tracing, as well as liberal use of testing, allowing doctors to perform tests at their own discretion. In recent times their response faltered, as the virus crept into poorer communities of migrant workers where testing was less prevalent. Interesting instance of Gandy’s panoptic sort? Worth noting Singapore is a fairly small island, so naturally a response ought to be easier than a large landlocked country (for instance)
South America:
# Venezuela:
Notable for how the conflict has exasperated the ongoing power struggle between President Maduro and National Assembly Leader Guiado, Venezuela suspended travel and declared a national stay at home order. It has used its centralized food distribution program, which already assigned a code to many poorer citizens, in order to enforce the lockdown and distribute aid.
# Brazil:
President Jair Bolsonaro is noted for his promotion of COVID conspiracy theories and peddling pseudoscientific cures for the virus. No national policies have been put in place but states can implement (and have implemented) their own responses. This includes stay at home and social distancing orders. No strong central surveillance used.
North America:
# United States (USA #1!!!)
Travel suspensions and ensuring logistical support for hospitals have been primary focuses of federal government. No federal stay at home or social distancing orders. States free to implement their own solutions, which have of course varied. No strong, federal, central surveillance used.
Africa:
# Egypt
Egypt has had a bizarrely xenophobic response, state media lobbies frequent accusations that foreign powers have created the virus for the purpose of biological warfare. With this said, the government has instituted a limited curfew and the military has performed sanitation work (Egyptian military is kind of weird they own a lot of private property and actually like make consumer goods like refrigerators and washing machines)
